## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Using ARIA standards for better accessibility.
- I made another version using only HTML and CSS. Figuring out the CSS for that was the hardest part for me. If you want to check it out, It is available in the branch **usingCheckbox**. Or you can click [this link](https://github.com/NiloyDas07/FAQ-Accordion/tree/usingCheckbox).

### Continued development

I will pay more attention to accessibility in my future work.

### Useful resources

- The most helpful tool for me was the Bing AI chat / Microsoft Copilot. It makes searching for answers to questions much easier and faster. It's completely free. And the best part is that we can ask follow up questions to get more specific answers. Be careful though, it can give wrong answers sometimes for more complicated stuff. But for basic questions, so far I have always recieved very good answers.
